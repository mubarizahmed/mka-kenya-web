        <p className='about-text'>Majlis Khuddamul Ahmadiyya is a spiritual organization of young men. Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya (MKA) was founded in 1938 by Khalifat-ul Masih II, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, the second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. According to the auxiliary’s founder, the name Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya literally means that its members are Servants of Ahmadiyya.</p>
        <p className='abou-text'>Khalifat-ul Masih II, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad established the tenets of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya to rest on the principles of service and sacrifice and to inculcate a commitment to one’s faith, one’s country, and to the world around them, tenets that still resonate through its international membership.The importance of Majlis Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya was so great that in 1940 membership was made compulsory for every young man between the ages of 16 and 40, and as a result, branches of Khuddam-ul-Ahmadiyya were established in all parts of the world.Every member of this organization is called Khadim (servant).</p>
